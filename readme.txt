Custom Content Types and Meta Fields built with WordPress native components. Modern, clean, and performance-focused.

== Description ==

Native Custom Fields is a modern WordPress plugin for creating custom content types, meta fields, and options pages using WordPress’ own native component system.

Instead of shipping a proprietary UI framework or custom database structure, Native Custom Fields leverages WordPress core technologies such as:

- @wordpress/scripts
- @wordpress/components
- @wordpress/elements
- @wordpress/icons
- @wordpress/data

This ensures a seamless, future-proof experience that evolves together with WordPress core.

= Why Native Custom Fields? =

Most custom field plugins introduce their own UI systems, internal data storage layers, or hidden configuration post types.

Native Custom Fields follows a different philosophy:

• Uses WordPress native UI components
• Stores configuration in wp_options
• Stores data in postmeta, termmeta, and usermeta
• Does not create unnecessary database tables
• Does not register hidden configuration post types
• Follows WordPress coding standards

The result is a clean, lightweight, and maintainable solution.

= Who is this plugin for? =

Native Custom Fields is built primarily for WordPress developers, agencies, and users who want full control over structured data while staying aligned with WordPress core standards.

Native Custom Fields uses WordPress’ official component system instead of a custom-built admin UI framework.

Yes. The plugin is built around the Block Editor architecture and uses native WordPress components.

= Do the free version have Repeater and Group fields? =

Yes. The free version has Repeater and Group fields. These are custom components built using WordPress native components recursively or grouped.


== Changelog ==
= 1.3.7 =
Security: The file upload AJAX action now requires the `upload_files` capability, not just a valid nonce.
Security: Deleting a post type configuration now requires `manage_options` instead of `edit_posts`.
Security: Reading an options page's saved configuration now requires `manage_options` instead of `edit_posts`.

= 1.3.6 =
Fixed: Repeater, group, file and multiple select fields were registered with the wrong meta type, so `register_meta` raised a "you must specify the schema for each array item" notice and dropped the meta from the REST API.
Fixed: The `native_custom_fields_register_post_meta_type` and `native_custom_fields_register_term_meta_type` filters received the meta key instead of the meta type as their filtered value.
Added: Array and object meta are now registered with a REST schema generated from the field configuration.
Updated: Hooks documentation now describes how the meta type is derived and when a custom schema is required.

= 1.3.5 =
Fixed: Repeater default values were not rendered on options pages until the section was reset.
Fixed: "Reset All" on an options page cleared repeater defaults instead of restoring them.
Fixed: Array defaults were flattened to an empty string for fields registered through the Abilities API.
Updated: Repeater control documentation now covers the `default` parameter.

= 1.3.4 =
Fixed: Post type archive did not work when "Has Archive" was enabled without a custom archive slug.
